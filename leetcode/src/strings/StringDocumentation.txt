Strings

String Immutable

String Pool

- Also known as the intern pool 
    - this is where Java stores all of the string literals after they are created
    - when a String is created, Java checks the String pool to see if a literal exists with that same value
    - if there is a literal with the same value, Java will point the new variable to the memeory address of the already existing literal
    - this eliminates the creation of duplicate values - ulitmately saving space
